## Setup
- Set needle valve to barely open 
- Place cup on scale under grouphead
- Hold single cup button to run pump
- Let pump run for 10 seconds
- Divide weight of water by 10 to get your flowrate in ml/s
- Adjust valve and rerun test until you get 1.4ml/s

## The Pull
- Set preinfusion time to 0 seconds

 - Aim to start pressure ramp around 18s
