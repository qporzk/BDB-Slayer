# Pulling Shots
 This will outline different methods to pull shots once the Slayer Mod has been performed.


## Classic Slayer Shot
This mimics the typical shot that would be pulled on an actual Slayer

### Setup
- Set needle valve to barely open 
- Place cup on scale under grouphead
- Hold single cup button to run pump
- Let pump run for 10 seconds
- Divide weight of water by 10 to get your flowrate in ml/s
- Adjust valve and rerun test until you get 1.4ml/s
- Make a mark on the machine so save this position
- Set preinfusion time to 0 seconds

### The Pull
- Install portafilter
- Set valve to 1.4ml/s mark
- Press manual button to start shot
- Preinfuse for desired time
  - Aim to start pressure ramp around 18s
  - First drops should start around 20s 
  - Pressure should get to 9 bar at about 25s
- Open valve for desired amount of full flow time
  - Aim for 2/3 of your total output weight
- Set valve back to 1.4ml/s mark
- Press manual button to stop the shot when target weight is reached (or a bit before)


## Blooming Espresso Shot
This shot mimics the blooming espresso outlined in Scott Rao's blog post: https://www.scottrao.com/blog/2018/7/18/advanced-mode-on-the-de1

### Setup
- Perform pump kill switch mod
- Find and mark 4ml/s point as above
- Find and mark 2.2ml/s point as above
